    $> elixir -v

    # Erlang/OTP 27 [erts-15.2.4] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

    ```

4. Install dependencies:

   mix phx.server
   ```

6. Open your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)


## Notes
HAR traces can and will capture all data input and output from the captured browser session. Some data maybe senstive and contain PII. Please be aware that the traces are displayed `as-is` and will not automatically redact senstive material PII from the trace.

> It will however remove the bearer token from the HTTP headers when the trace is displayed. If the OAUTH bearer token called `Authorization` is passed, the value will always be displayed as `REDACTED`.


## Feature backlog
- ~~Streamline UI design.~~
- ~~Ability to redact known sensitve data like `bearer tokens`.~~
- Time-based garbage collection of the HAR file RAM cache.

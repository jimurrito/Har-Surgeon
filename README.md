## Setup

> **From source build is the only option as of now**. OS-based releases will eventually be added to allow for execution of the app without needing to install the toolchain.

### From Source

1. Install Elixir 1.18 and Erland OTP 27:

    - [Elixir 1.18](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
    - [Erland OTP 27](https://www.erlang.org/downloads/27)

2. Validate install:
    ```bash
    $> elixir -v

    # Erlang/OTP 27 [erts-15.2.4] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]
    # Elixir 1.18.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 27)
    ```

3. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jimurrito/har_surgeon.git
    cd har-surgeon
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ``` bash
    mix deps.get
    ```

5. Start the web server:
   ```
   mix phx.server
   ```

6. Open your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)


## Notes
HAR traces can and will capture all data input and output from the captured browser session. Some data maybe senstive and contain PII. Please be aware that the traces are displayed `as-is` and will not automatically redact senstive material PII from the trace.

> It will however remove the bearer token from the HTTP headers when the trace is displayed. If the OAUTH bearer token called `Authorization` is passed, the value will always be displayed as `REDACTED`.


## Feature backlog
- ~~Streamline UI design.~~
- ~~Ability to redact known sensitve data like `bearer tokens`.~~
- Time-based garbage collection of the HAR file RAM cache.
